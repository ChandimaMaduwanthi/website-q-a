However, it offers much more than just an ordinary Sri Lankan village experience.The pristine Ulpotha retreat is located in the north-central region of Sri Lanka, within the Cultural Triangle. It is only open to guests who have pre-booked one of the many two-week yoga retreats on offer. What sets this retreat apart is its ability to bring in some of the world's best yoga instructors for your practice. Additionally, it offers a range of massages, therapies, and Ayurvedic treatments, immersing you in the lifestyle of an authentic Sri Lankan village as it would have been a century ago.During our one-week stay at Ulpotha (the required minimum stay is one week from Sunday to Sunday, although the owners encourage guests to join for the full two weeks of a yoga retreat for the complete experience), we came to realize the importance of disconnecting from our modern lives and embracing the calm, quaint, and romantic charm of village life.
